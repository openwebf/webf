// We need to avoid having static constructors. This is accomplished by defining
// a buffer of the appropriate size and alignment, and defining a const
// reference that points to the buffer. During initialization, the object will
// be constructed with placement new into the buffer. This works with MSVC, GCC,
// and Clang without producing dynamic initialization code even at -O0. The only
// downside is that all external translation units will have to emit one more
// load, while a real global could be referenced directly by absolute or
// relative addressing.

// Use an array of pointers instead of an array of char in case there is some
// alignment issue.
